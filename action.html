		<h2> The Empress and the Cake</h2>
		<h3> Linda Stift </h3>
		<p>

What a bizarre & disturbing read - but increasing addictive and impossible to look away. A seemingly innocent act of hospitality by an elderly lady towards a young woman she meets in a bakery slowly reveals itself to be something much more sinister. This tiny novel packs a powerful punch of sickening excess, freakish horror & uncomfortable laughter. The dual narrative bounces the reader between centuries - cranking up the surreal to full pitch.

It took a lot of hard practice to learn how to vomit silently. I began by sticking down my throat toothbrushes, paintbrushes or ostrich plumes, which I'd bought specifically for this purpose having read that these were what the ancient Romans used. I had no success with my fingers as I couldn't poke them down far enough, to the area where the vomiting reflex begins. I was unable, however, to spare myself the grazed and scarred knuckles that result from constantly rubbing the roof of one's mouth, because I tried it over and over again. The handles chafed my throat until it bled, and that always gave me such a shock that I'd interrupt my puking. Which meant that not everything came out.

		<h2> Thirst </h2>
		<h3> Kerry Hudson </h3>
		<p>
Siberian Alena and Londoner Dave both tried to do what their single-parent mothers asked. Kerry Hudson pulls no punches describing the horrible results, particularly for sex-trafficked Alena, and the pair's inability to forgive themselves for what happened. BUT and it's a big but - together they just might be able to turn their lives around. Read this marvellous book and find out.

Away from Clapham, Soho and that cold toilet cubicle, Alena had wrapped herself in Dave, her job, in the people and sounds and smells of Hackney. She had hidden in a happiness she didn't deserve and now when she walked from door to door she wasn't pulling the trolley of newspapers behind her, she pulled all those girls .... She smelt their cheap body spray covering the smell of unwanted men ... the life being fucked out of the chubby hopeful faces she had betrayed.

Beverly thinks suddenly of the rooster eggcup that had once belonged to her grandmother. As a toddler, Colleen had hurled the eggcup at the fridge and cracked off the rooster's head. Beverly had been inconsolable. An instant, jagged disappointment entirely out of proportion had ripped through her as she watched the china head dance over the kitchen tiles. The broken eggcup had brought her to an understanding: being a mother was an entrapment.

Eighteen-year-old Andrea has come to Barcelona in 1943 to attend university and 'learn about life'. She moves uneasily between rich classmates, would-be artists, slum dwellers and the human wrecks who are her own family, aware always of her own hunger - not just for food. Would be a great reading group choice but also recommended for anyone who loves Spain or has ever been young and unsure of themself.

 'It's as if you'd lived on your own in a Red zone and not in a convent of nuns during the war. Even Gloria has more excuses than you in her yearning for emancipation and disorder. She's a little street slut, while you've received an education ... and don't excuse yourself with your curiosity to see Barcelona. I've shown you Barcelona.'
Instinctively I looked at my watch.
'You listen to me like a person listening to the rain, I can see that ... you wretch! Life will batter you, crush you, flatten you! Then you'll think of me...'

The beautifully shaded and emotive relationship between the techie, autistic teenager and his worried, protective mother is satisfying enough, so it's almost an anticlimax when the cyber-warfare thriller action kicks in, but that's more than compensated by the metaphysical, hyper-evolutionary pyrotechnics- Gaia hypothesis meets The Matrix via The Bourne Identity.

For a moment, by default - because guns have always meant games- Colt applies game logic; assumes that he has transitioned back into the gameworld, or forgotten he was in the gameworld; and Colt reaches for his own gun; but he doesn't have one.
And disentangling the levels of reality; realising that his father is real, and has a real gun, and that Colt is unarmed; this has taken up a lot of realtime, because some of the thinking is using his old brain structures; it is slooooooow; and his new brain structures can't decide what to do until he knows what is real and what is not.
