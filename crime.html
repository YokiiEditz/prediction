		<h2> The Company Man </h2>
		<h3>Robert Jackson Bennett </h3>
		<p>
Steampunk, alternate history, even dieselpunk? I don't know, but this story reads like a dark thriller at first. There are gruesome murders and buddy themes echoing Holmes and Watson (or Mulder and Scully). A bleak brooding city where nothing is what it seems provides an unsettling backdrop to disturbing and horrifying happenings. Climaxes and fantasy build until the biggest, Messianic, secret of all is uncovered. I just had to keep reading.

It was almost like something under the city had spoken to him. Spoken to him and caused his attack. And strange as the vision had been, what disturbed him more was what had come just before it, because for one second Hayes had not heard whispers from the minds of those nearby but almost a loud shout from a single mind, one that was vaster than any he'd ever encountered. An enormous and strange consciousness, somehow buried under the city, and waiting for him, imagining a ruined Evesden underneath a dark sky.

		<h2> The Big Music </h2>
		<h3> Kirsty Gunn </h3>
		<p>

Structured as if in musical form and written as a collection of 'selected papers', you are immersed in the obsessional world of bagpipe music. You hear the low drone in the sonorously, lyrical prose echoing in the landscape and understand the meaning of home and loneliness, love and loss. The rhythm and repetition of the music is mirrored in the text as the story of fathers and sons unfolds. Not an easy read but enchanting and original.
<div class="style">

<p>
So, yes, then, a Lament, for the one who’s leaving – but a Lament too for everything he’s let slip away, the pride and the thoughts of himself as a big man, the big man and all that come to nothing. Those notes too will be worn into the tune. His failure as a father, a son, as a husband and lover – those flattened phrases too and those lines will sound out amongst the theme, his return, no matter how high the music can reach, always going back to his own note, the endless ‘A’. The sound of someone who’s not been able to remove himself from his own mind to see the ways and needs of others, for one minute, not for one minute.
‘Lament for Himself’, indeed.
For that is how it has always been.
Always…Just…Himself.

		<h2> The Crossroads </h2>
		<h3> Niccolo Ammaniti </h3>
		<p>

TThis is not 'holiday' Italy; instead it's a gritty, ugly, poverty-scarred landscape experienced by Christiano and his drunken father. You just know that something terrible will happen to these people, but it's almost impossible to anticipate the twists and turns of the plot. Much like real life, this story is messy, unexpected and violent; caring deeply about someone is no guarantee that you won't hurt them.

Why don't you go to bed? The question was on the tip of his tongue, but he checked it. From the way his father was pacing around the room there wasn't much chance of him calming down.
Three stars.

Christiano ranked his father's rages on a five-star scale.

No, three to four. Already in the 'approach with caution' area, where the only strategy was to agree with everything he said and keep out of the way as much as possible.

		<h2> Waking Lions</h2>
		<h3> Ayelet Gunder-Goshen </h3>
		<p>

Life, the predictable pattern of work and family routine, can be passing as normal when the disastrous breaks in and opens up the cracks in our social and psychological makeup. The twin factors of denial and the desire to atone for another human's death, set up enough intrinsic stress but are screwed to destruction levels by medical ethics and racial/immigration issues. Our natural human way of exteriorising guilt is explored with tender insight.

 And that whole struggle with Marciano to let her continue investigating the Eritrean's death was only to prove to herself that she wasn't one of those people who thought all blacks were the same. Or one of those people who thought a good Arab was a dead Arab and a good Bedouin was a Bedouin in prison. She was different. But when it came right down to it, she wouldn't go to a swimming pool full of Arabs even if she ranted and raved when there was a sign at the entrance saying NO ARABS ALLOWED.

		<h2> Easter Island </h2>
		<h3> Jennifer Vanderbes </h3>
		<p>

What is the mystery of the moai of Easter Island and why do they call to intrepid travellers? Elsa and Greer both search for answers in different decades but at what cost? It is a fascinating voyage for the reader as the author skilfully concocts a mixture of archaeology, anthropology, botany and travelogue adding a pinch of romance, betrayal and sacrifice. Like drinking a Pisco Sour - tangy and surprising.

<div class="style">
<h4>Extract:</h4>
<p>
Even in this 'land of dreams' she had felt the momentary anguish of solitude. And how could she not? The island was like a thing of myths, a fear made physical: solitude itself. And that perhaps was one of the reasons she'd come, to explore the geography of her loneliness
