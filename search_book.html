		<h2>Companions of Paradise</h2>
		<h3>Thalassa Ali</h3>
		<p>

Lovers of well-written historical romance rejoice! Cross-cultural and spiritual divides are explored in the concluding drama of a trilogy set against a backdrop of India and Afghanistan during British rule. The Sufi mysticism imbues the storytelling with a depth of authenticity which springs from experience rather than pure research. The author’s obvious passion for the people and region draws you in and keeps you reading.

<p>Pride. Mariana's munshi had told her that pride meant everything to an Afghan. Any one of them, especially a Pushtoon tribesman, would willingly throw away his life to prove a point of defend a principle. He would never forget a service, would defend a guest to the death, and would offer asylum to anyone who asked properly, even someone who had murdered a member of his own family.
'If an Afghan's honour requires revenge' her old teacher had said, 'he will exact it, whatever the price. We have a saying in India: may God save me from the fangs of the snake, the claws of the tiger, and the vengeance of the Afghan.'</div>

		<h2>This is Life</h2>
		<h3>Dan Rhodes</h3>
		<p>
Based in Paris, love at first sight is the norm in this scatty, madcap comic novel. Full of irony and dark humour, the author pokes fun at performance art and the French political scene, leaving you none the wiser about whether life imitates art or the other way round. You find yourself willingly suspending disbelief in this skillfully wrought, furiously paced farce.

<h4>Extract:</h4>
<p>He saw the baby first from the other side of the square. His eyes were drawn to the child, who was just waking up. There was something about him, about his serious expression and line of his brow that he found mesmerising. He was so absorbed by the sight of the boy that it was a while before he noticed the commotion surrounding him. The first participant he saw was the old woman, determinedly pushing the buggy across the square. And beside her, at first protesting, then trying to wrest control of the buggy, was the girl. The girl, the one he had been waiting for all his life. Until this moment he’d had no idea that he had been waiting for anyone all his life, but now he knew he had been, and here she was.

		<h2> Park and Ride</h2>
		<h3>Miranda Sawyer</h3>
		<p>Gently amusing this is any easy read for those times when you want a book but can't make the effort to think. May strike a chord with those of you who grew up in the suburbs, in the 1980s, with a passion for while stilettos.

		<h2>The Anatomy School</h2>
		<h3>Bernard MacLaverty</h3>
		<p>A tale of 1960s Belfast told in two parts. Part one is full of rich characters and witty dialogue. Naive Martin and his friends, pre-occupied with the thorny issues of religion, sex and morality study for their A Levels under the watchful eye of various priests. There's brilliantly funny repartee, especially from the guests who join Martin's mother for her regular supper evenings. Part 2 touches on the troubles in Belfast and Martin's life after he leaves school but does not seem to be fully integrated into the novel as a whole and I felt a bit disappointed at the end.

<p>Here, Father, take a napkin,' said Mrs Brennan 'You wouldn't think black would stain but its nearly worse than anything else.'
'You're right there,' said Father Farquharson 'It practically highlights a stain.'
'I hope my shoes don't stain' said Mary Lawless 'The language of the young ones nowadays coming out of that pub - it would frighten you'.
'Merciful hour,' said Mrs Brennan 'They're a holy terror.'
'You were coming out of a pub, Mary?' said Nurse Gilliand.
'Indeed I was not. It was a crowd of young ones.'

<p>I had my right elbow on the table at this point, my chin resting flatteringly on my hands I gave him my full rapt attention. The conversation had become positively intellectual by now. After we'd somehow got onto Poems on the Underground, he'd said the best poetry invariably contained some profound philosphical truth. So I put on my best intelligently riveted look which was a bit difficult while I was having a wriggly mini-fantasy about what it'd be like to kiss him.</div>
